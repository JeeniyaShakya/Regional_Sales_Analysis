# Regional_Sales_Analysis

## Problem Statement
Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of regional performance, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities and optimize resources. Inconsistent revenue and profit performance across U.S. regions reduces the ability to allocate budgets effectively and scale high-performing segments.

Leverage 5 years of historical sales data to analyze and visualize regional performance. The project aims to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making by identifying growth levers across regions, channels, products, and customers.

## Key Visuals
